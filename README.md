# Showcase

**Quick note: This is a project that is still in development and does not have a
clear road map on how to approach the problem. This repo will change drastically
over the next couple weeks and might completely restart the implementation.**

## Description

This will be a tool that you can use to deploy an ssh server that will be able
to pull your projects, install them, and any one that remotes into the server
through ssh will be able to use your configured projects.

## Why

A backend developer develops cli apps, apis, and tui applications and those are
harder to showcase than a website. The tools and projects that a backend 
developer looking for a job will make are typically not installed by a lot of
people, people that are wanting to try it out might not have the required
dependencies or have different versions of them.

To solve this I want to be able to deploy an ssh server that will have a list of
my project and a reproducible environment for anyone to try out, without any
installation or management of dependencies in your own machine.
